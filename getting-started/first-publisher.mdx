For each of your publishers (websites), you will need to create a publisher in our system. This will be the place you set up your ad units, and get your ads.txt requirements and the all-important publisher tag!

Simply navigate to the publisher's section and click the "New Publisher" button. Enter the publisher domain (for https://www.example.com/ the domain is: example.com).

You can enter an optional label to help you identify the publisher, for example, if you have a separate forum and blog, you might want to label them accordingly.

Hit the "Create publisher" button and you will be taken to your newly created publisher!

We recommend you put the publisher tag live on your site as soon as possible. The tag won't go live until you turn it on, but by putting it live now, you minimise any delay in the approval process.
