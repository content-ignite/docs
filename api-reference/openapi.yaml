    # Introduction

    Welcome to the Content Ignite API. A central place for all Content Ignite
    functionality. 


    This API enforces a separation between function and form, meaning anything
    you can do in our platforms can be replicated in your own bespoke solution.


    # Authentication

    Authentication is handled via JWTs. You can retrieve your unique JSON Web
    Token from the settings page in the platform, which needs to be passed in
    with every request.

    To do this, simple include it in an Authorization header with the "Bearer"
    key word.


    Please contact support for help getting started.


    # Error Codes

    This is a fully RESTful API, so prepare for a number of different HTTP
    status codes.


    There is also a standard "success" field returned for each request. This
    boolean value can provide a first check against a response.


    # Rate limit

    We reserve the right to block requests if we deem a client to be abusing the
    API.
