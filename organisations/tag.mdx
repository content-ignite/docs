<Warning>
  It is always better to use individual publisher tags as opposed to this "Run
  Of Network" style tag as this introduces an extra network hop, and therefore
  marginal upfront latency.
</Warning>

Our Organisation Tag is a "Run Of Network" style tag designed to make a rollout across a large number of publishers easier when centrally managed.

Every organisation has an organisation tag generated automatically. This tag will dynamically load the correct publisher tag based on a domain match (ignoring subdomain). Therefore, ensure that the domain name entered for a publisher inside Fusion is correct — otherwise, no ads will be displayed.

## Management

There is no separate management for organisation tags; they simply load a publisher tag.

Configuring of publisher tags is handled at the publisher level. See [Publisher Tags](/publishers/tag) for more information.
