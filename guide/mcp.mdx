## Prerequisite: Node.js

The MCP server requires Node.js to run. Verify your Node.js installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:

```
node --version
```

If Node.js is not installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). We recommend the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.

## Configuring your client

        <Steps>
            <Step title="Open Claude Desktop Settings">
                Start by accessing the Claude Desktop settings. Click on the Claude menu in
                your system’s menu bar (not the settings within the Claude window itself)
                and select “Settings…” 
                
                On macOS, this appears in the top menu bar

                This opens the Claude Desktop configuration window, which is separate from your Claude account settings.

            </Step>
            <Step title="Access Developer Settings">
                In the Settings window, navigate to the “Developer” tab in the left sidebar. This section contains options for configuring MCP servers and other developer features.

                Click the “Edit Config” button to open the configuration file.

                This action creates a new configuration file if one doesn’t exist, or opens your existing configuration. The file is located at:

                - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
                - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

            </Step>
            <Step title="Configure the Filesystem Server">
                Replace the contents of the configuration file with the following JSON structure. This configuration tells Claude Desktop to start the Content Ignite MCP Server with access to your specific account:

                ```json
                {
                    "mcpServers": {
                        "Content Ignite": {
                            "command": "npx",
                            "args": [
                                "-y"
                                "mcp-remote",
                                "https://docs.contentignite.com/mcp",
                                "--header",
                                "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"
                            ],
                            "env": {
                                "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer <auth-token>"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                ```

                Ensure you replacing `<auth-token>` with your **API Access Token** from your [Fusion account page](https://admin.contentignite.com/account).
            </Step>
            <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
                After saving the configuration file, completely quit Claude Desktop and restart it. The application needs to restart to load the new configuration and start the MCP server.

                Upon successful restart, you’ll see an MCP server indicator in the bottom-right corner of the conversation input box.

                Click on this indicator to view the available tools provided by the Content Ignite MCP Server.

                If the server indicator doesn’t appear, reach out to your account manager for assistance.
