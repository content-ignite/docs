| **Ad Usage**                                    | For self-serve publishers, they will be billed on either on 'Ad Unit Load' (when a target is found and an ad unit is triggered on page) or 'Ad Requests' (when an ad is requested from the ad server). The publisher, if a self-serve publisher, will be billed on whichever of 'Ad Unit Loads' and 'Ad Requests' is higher at month-end, which therefore is defined as 'Ad Usage' and this 'Ad Usage' figure will be taken from Platform reporting |
