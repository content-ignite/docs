Each day thousands of events are triggered in our platform, anything from aknowledging the re-build of a publisher tag, to urgent health alerts for things like revenue drop-off.

Integrations allow you connect in a messaging system such as Slack, to receive these events into a central group.

You can of course choose the types of events you want to be notified about, and where those messages end up.

## Event Groups

After you go through the connection process for the platform of your choice (choosing where notifications should go), you'll be able to pick which event groups you wish to subscribe to, these are as follows:
