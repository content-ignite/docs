Each day thousands of events are triggered in our platform, anything from aknowledging the re-build of a publisher tag, to urgent health alerts for things like revenue drop-off.

Each user has the ability to receive these notifications via web push notifications or email, or through the [connection of a communications integration](/integrations/comms) at the organisation level.

Be sure to whitelist no-reply@hey.contentignite.com in your email provider to ensure you receive email notifications.

Web notifications will only be delivered if you have Fusion open in your browser. If you'd like more consistent delivery of push notifications, consider [installing Fusion as a web application](/getting-started/top-tips#web-app).

## Organisation Hierarchy

If you have access to multiple organisation, weather that's in a parent-child arrangement, or separate entities, your subscription to the above events is managed per organisation. That means if you switch organisations, you'd be able to manage all your preferences independently.
