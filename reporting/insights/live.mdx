Live reporting is a powerful real-time monitoring tool. Imagine you are about to deploy a new site template and want to be sure it hasn't impacted your ad opportunities. This tool provides a second-by-second view of key metrics, as well as latency, so you’ll instantly know where things stand.

The top graph displays key metrics such as ad impressions and page impressions, while the bottom graph shows tag latency stats.

You can use the filter draw to remove metrics from the charts, helping you focus on what matters most. For example, if ad impressions are overshadowing page impressions, you can hide them for a clearer view.

## What this report is, and what it isn't

This is not a performance report. It does not show revenue (which, unfortunately, is not possible from Google Ad Manager). It's also not a report you keep up on your screen all day - Fusion can alert you to key "drop-off" events, so there’s no need to monitor these charts obsessively.

What this report **is**: a real-time tool for monitoring key metrics while making site changes. The impact of site modifications isn’t always obvious, and unintended consequences can occur. Watching live data can give you peace of mind, or an early warning signal that something's not quite right - allowing you to react quickly before any damage can be done.
