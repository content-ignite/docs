The Revenue Insights Hub gives you a clear, all-in-one view of your publisher earnings, helping you explore performance from every angle – see what’s working, what’s not, and where the biggest opportunities are. With visual breakdowns and flexible filters, it’s never been easier to uncover insights, spot gaps, and maximise your earning potential.

Here are the key tab views found in the Revenue Insights Hub:

## Overview

The Overview tab (default view) pulls together the total revenue data into a single view. You’ll get top-level stats showing overall revenue, plus fixed-period comparison figures to give you a broader picture of how things are trending.

A revenue chart then break this down further, showing date trends for a deeper look into revenue performance over the selected date range. And finally, there’s a fully exportable table that brings together a range of metrics – giving you the tools to filter, sort, and analyse the data however suits you best.

## Dimension Views

Each dimension view lets you break things down even further, showing exactly where your revenue is coming from. TThese views pull out the top ten performers (by gross revenue) in each dimension category, highlighting both the best and worst performers so you can spot any weak areas and make smart, data-backed decisions to optimise your setup.

The graphs show revenue and eCPM by day, so you get a full picture of how things stack up over time – and you’ll still have access to the same exportable data table for deeper analysis across all dimensions.

For even more detailed insights, you can filter by a specific dimension from all results to provide a detailed breakdown and help track performance over time on a specific level.

## Filter Options

As with other Insights Hub pages, the global filters for Publisher and Date will shape the data you see. On top of that, you’ll find a few extra filters on this page to help narrow things down even more.

### Dimension Filter

When you’re viewing a specific dimension tab, you’ll get a Dimension Filter dropdown to pick a particular dimension to focus on. This updates the charts to show just that dimension across the date range, instead of gathering all results together. It’s a handy way to follow trends and spot shifts in a single area – whether that’s a specific publisher, device type, or geo.

### Further Fine-tuning

Along with global filters for Date and Publisher that influence the data, Revenue Insights offers additional flexibility for data presentation. You can toggle between Gross and Net revenue views, depending on your preference. Graphs can also be adjusted to show totals or percentages, allowing you to analyse performance in different ways. Furthermore, filter exclusions allow you to toggle chart overlay lines, providing more control over how the data is displayed, helping you focus on the most relevant insights.

## Publisher Filtering

In some cases, depending on your organisation setup or if a global publisher filter is applied, the Publisher tab won’t show anything beyond what’s already available in the Overview tab.

When a global publisher filter is in place, you’ll see a message letting you know that the same view can be found in the Overview, along with a tip on how to adjust filters to access a broader breakdown of publisher revenue.

If the Publisher tab is completely inaccessible, it’s likely because your organisation only has a single publisher – in which case, there’s no additional comparison data to show you beyond what you see in the Overview.
