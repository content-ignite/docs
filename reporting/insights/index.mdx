Welcome to one of the most powerful and exciting sections of Fusion (yes, we are all data nerds!).

The Insights Hub is a visual reporting centre designed to deliver actionable insights into specific aspects of your ad tech setup. From diagnostics and ads.txt deep dives to sustainability metrics, this is where you can truly explore performance and uncover opportunities to maximise your earnings.

## Navigating the Insights Hub

Landing in the Insights Hub you will see all the reports available to you. Simply click on a report to dive straight into the insights.

### Header

Individual reports may initially display a network-wide (all publishers) view of data or prompt you to select a specific publisher via the publisher filter. This filter is located in the Insights Hub header, which remains consistent across reports. At any time, you can adjust the report’s focus by selecting a different publisher.

Another key filter is the date range filter, available in most reports. This allows you to choose from preset date ranges or define a custom start and end date. A particularly useful feature is our grouped date periods; Month-on-Month and Quarter-on-Quarter. These options group data by month or quarter instead of by day, making it easier to identify long-term trends. Above the date field, you’ll see your selection displayed as a start and end date for clarity, especially when using predefined ranges.

Additional controls can be found in the top-right section of the page header. These include a refresh button to fetch fresh data, and a back button to jump back to the main Insights Hub landing page.

#### Advanced Filters

One last button exists in the far-right of the header - the filter button. This appears only on pages where additional filters (beyond publisher and date) are available. Clicking this will toggle the filter drawer, revealing extra filtering options.

These additional filters can significantly alter report behaviour. For example, in the **SSP Hub**, selecting a specific advertising partner transforms the report into a focused view of that partner over time.

Closing the filter drawer provides more screen space for charts, while a badge on the filter button indicates how many filters are available.

To reset all filters to their default values, simply click the bin icon within the filter drawer.

#### Quick Navigation

Once inside a report, you can click the colourful icon button to the left of the report title to open up a quick navigation menu. This allows you to jump into another report with ease, with the added benefit of persistence.

#### Bookmarking & Persistence

Any filters you select within a report are saved to the page URL. This means you can copy the page URL and share it with a colleague, who will see the exact same view, including all selected filters, when they open the link.

We even take this a step further: if you select an individual publisher for a report, that publisher selection persists as you navigate to other reports. This goes for all filters that are consistent across pages, such as date range or net vs gross revenue.

### Charts

Charts are a key part of the Insights Hub, as visualising data is crucial for understanding trends and performance. Charts will typically show a number of metrics that can be controlled by filters.

In cases where a large volume of data is requested (say you choose "Last year" as your date range), charts may group data points to ensure they remain usable both from a performance and UX perspective. For example, too many bars in a bar chart would become compressed, making it difficult to distinguish time periods.

### Tables

Where possible, reports include a data table, typically containing the full dataset used to power the charts and other views on the page.

This is particularly powerful as it gives you the flexibility to export that data and use in your own reporting tools if you so wish.

These tables also come with a range of familiar spreadsheet-like features, including filtering, grouping, pinning, sorting, aggregation, and column hiding. Simply hover over a column header and click the three vertical dots to open the column menu.
