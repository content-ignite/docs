The revenue report is your main insight into publisher performance. Giving you a highly transparent breakdown of costs and even the viewability of impressions.

These reports are designed to be built for your needs, allowing complete customisation over date ranges, fields and filters.

<Note>
    **GAM integration without reporting**

    If you chose to use your own Google Ad Manager account, and connect it in without reporting, or opt for the manual integration option, you will see substantially less in this report.

    You will get a basic impressions report (which is what your billing is based on) broken down by ad unit.

</Note>

## Building your report

Clicking "New report" will take you to the report build view, where you can select you data range, fields and filters.

If you give your report a title you can save it for re-use later, or to just generate a one off report, you can simply click "Run" after you have made your selections.

## Available Fields

There is a large amount of data available via this report, explanations of each column can be found by hovering over the field in the report builder interface, or over the column header if you have already ran the report.

Due to the complexities of advertising, you will likely come across a column that doesn't make sense against another column like "How can ad responses be higher than ad impressions?" or columns that sound similar where the differences aren't immediately clear. These are valid and common questions, so to help we have listed answers to common questions in the help modal accessible from the info icon in the top right, or via [Field Nuances](#field-nuances) further down this page.

## Field Nuances

### (Estimated) Net Revenue

If you are using only Content Ignite ad demand (P&P) then net revenue
is straight forward, it will be the gross earnings with your revenue
share applied, and outside of the 4 day reconciliation period, can be
relied upon and will match your invoiced payout.

However, things get a little more complex for SaaS customers, as fees
are calculated from ad usage, which has a tiered pricing structure
applied, so with greater volumes, discounted rates apply. Meaning that
as you progress through a month, the RPM value may decrease. Net
revenue will also rarely match your invoice amount because ad usage is
calculated from all units across your entire network for the month as
a whole, so pulling reports for single publishers or over varying date
ranges means we have to estimate the billable impressions accordingly.
This is why the fields are labeled as "estimate".

### Ad unit loads vs Ad requests vs Ad responses vs Ad impressions

The lifecycle of an ad request starts with an ad unit load, this means
we found a target match on the page, and our unit was loaded, ready to
request an ad, however, our in-view technology may not make that
request if the unit is out of view of the user. Therefore Ad unit
loads can be higher than ad requests.

Ad requests are just that, requests to the ad server to ask for an ad.
We typically aim for the highest yield for our publishers meaning the
most revenue, and with that comes fill that is under 100%. If ad
refresh is enabled, then ad request may be a lot higher than ad unit
loads which only loads once per page load.

Ad responses mean the ad server has successfully returned an ad. As we
don't aim for 100% fill, this will typically be less than ad requests.

Next, we have ad impressions. This means that we have taken the ad
returned from the server, placed it on the page and all the images
have been downloaded to the users' browser allowing the ad creative to
be viewed by the user. This will typically be slightly lower than ad
responses as users could navigate away from the page between receiving
the ad response and rending the ad creative to the page.

Finally, we have viewable impressions. This is counted as having at
least 50% of the ads area visible on the users' screen for at least
one second. This is typically less than ad impressions, again as the
user could navigate or scroll away before this threshold is met.

### Unit Fill vs Ad Server Fill vs Fill

Fill is the common ad reporting metric of ad impressions divided by ad requests, to give you a percentage of how many ad requests actually led to an ad impressions. It is worth noting that Content Ignite does <u>not</u> aim for 100% fill, but instead aims for the highest yield, boosting the value of your inventory and maximising your revenue. Therefore, seeing blank ads is normal.

Ad Server fill is similar to fill, but compares ad requests to ad responses, removing user behaviour form the equation. This gives you a picture of overall bidding and win rate. Low fill here might signal that floor prices are too high for example.

Unit fill is by contrast, a measurement of opportunity. It is calculated from ad responses divided by ad unit loads, which as detailed above, is when the intended target is found on page but has not necessarily triggered an ad request. This value can go above 100% if ad refresh is enabled.

## Results Table Features

What may at first seem like a simple reporting table actually contains several powerful features that allow you to dice up and drill down into your data.

Clicking the three vertical dots next to any column header will give you several options:

### Column Visibility &amp; pinning

Clicking the "Show columns" option will allow you to hide fields you don't need in that moment, in order to achieve a focused view.

You can even pin or "freeze" columns to keep them in view as you scroll across large data sets.

### Sorting

Click any column header to sort by that column, click again to reverse the sort or even hold down `cmd` (Mac), `ctrl` (Windows) and click multiple headers to achieve a multi-column sort!

### Filtering

Filter any field with various options for comparison operators, and view a single ad unit's performance across a subset of your publishers for example.

### Grouping

Reports are broken out into a granular view by default. Want to see a single daily summary by publisher instead? Use grouping to achieve just that.

### Aggregation

Select from various aggregation functions such as average, count or sum to populate the summary footer with values. These are set to values that make sense for the given column by default but can be changed to suit your needs.

### Saving and resetting table state

If you have reordered columns and adjusted sizes and sorting (among other things) you can save that layout for next time you (or anyone else) uses that report. Great for those dynamic date range reports that will get used time and time again.

You can of corse play around with filters etc and not save, to get the data you need in that moment.

You can also reset the table state back to how it started at any time with the "Reset" button.

### AI Assistant

All of the above can be magically applied through a natural language request (text or voice) using the built in AI assistant. Click the little speech bubble icon and type (or talk) your filtering requirements and let AI do the rest!

## API Reporting

You can pull all the same data you see in our UI, via our REST API. For more information, got to [API Reporting](/reporting/api)
