Billing can be found in the primary navigation of the platform. From here you can see your current month's estimate, your billing profile set up and your invoice history.

## Profiles

We allow the set up of two organisation billing profiles; one for paying out and one for collection.

Payouts come from using the Content Ignite ad server within your publisher tags. Our demand fills the ad units and earnings get paid directly to us on Net30 terms, we then pass this on to you the publisher after applying our agreed revenue share.

Collections come from using your own ad server (using our tech on a SaaS basis) or from using our contextual features where we charge you on a simple per-page-crawl basis.

Your account allows you to use any combination of features you wish, you can use our ad server in some places, and your own in others! As you set up various use cases throughout the system, you will be prompted to set up the relevant billing profile if you have not done so already.

### Processing Bills

If you have a mixed set-up where both collection and payout profiles are required, we will calculate the sum of what we owe you, and what you owe us each month. We will then make a single payment in the direction required.

It is important you have both billing profiles in place if requested of you. While it might be the case that your payout total will always exceed your collection total (meaning you will never be charged), invoices can vary month by month and if we can not take payment your account may be disabled.

## Currency Usage

Currency is set as part of your payment setup (you can set the currency your dashboard is shown in separately). We are always looking to support as many countries/currencies as possible, so if you don't see yours on the support list, please do [get in touch](https://resource.contentignite.com/support).

Invoices will always be generated in GBP (our base currency) but will be paid out / collected according to your configured local currency, with the final exchange rate/amount details shown at the time of payment.

## Fees

You will not be charged fees for billing in your local currencies. Exchange values are taken at the time of payment and we use mid-market rates to ensure you get the truest value, no hidden nasties!

You can check out current rates and subscribe to rate notifications here: [https://wise.com/tools/exchange-rate-alerts/](https://wise.com/tools/exchange-rate-alerts/)

## Invoice Parent

If your organisation is configured with child organisations, you can enable "Invoice Parent" on each child. This will mean that the invoice and subsequent payment will be made to you, and not directly to the child.

This trickles down to all children. For example, consider the following setup:

```
    Parent Organisation (you)
    ├── Child 1
    ├── Child 2
         └── Child 3
```

If you enable pay parent on child 2, you will receive invoices and payment for all publishers under child 2 and child 3.

This setting removes all payment setting screens from the child. They will however still see their reporting and will be told that payment will be directed to their parent organisation.

## Collection - SaaS

SaaS fees are calculated off of impressions served.

SaaS pricing is tiered, meaning if you cross a certain ad impression threshold, the CPM cost decreases. This means that reporting partway through the month may show a higher CPM which may decrease throughout the month as more impressions register under a cheaper tier.

Ad impressions are totals at the liable parent organisation level, for example, if you have one parent organisation and multiple child organisations that are all configured to "Invoice parent", then the total ad impressions across all child organisations are used to calculate cost. This ensures you get the best rate through use of the higher impression pricing tiers.

### Supported Currencies

The following currencies are supported for payment collection:

## Payout - P&P

Earnings from the use of Content Ignite demand is paid based on an agreed revenue share. For example 85/15 where the larger amount (85%) goes to you, the publisher. You will see the revenue share applied in reporting for the `Net revenue` and `RPM` fields.

## Billing Estimates

For each active billing profile, you will see a running month estimate.

Please note, this is just an estimate and does not take accurately into account exchange rates, as these are calculated at the time of invoice processing.

## Net30

We invoice on Net30 terms. We generate invoices on the 6th of each month, that are due 30 days after the 1st of that month (this allows for ad server deductions).

For example, March's invoice would be generated on the 6th of April and will be paid out on the 30th of April.

## Invoice History

The invoice history table will show all the invoices we have issued, when they are due and the current status.

You can click on an invoices description to view further details including a breakdown by publisher.

For non-GBP currencies, you may see an invoice without an exchange rate, exchange rates are fixed once payment has been initiated, at which point the invoice will be updated to reflect this.

### Invoice Life Cycle

An invoice life cycle consists of many different stages, the explanation for which can be found below. If additional explanatory information is available for any given stage, it will be displayed via a little 'info' icon.
