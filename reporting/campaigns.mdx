Running ad campaigns helps you reach your audience, boost your brand, and drive results. Campaign reporting gives you the insights you need to see what’s working and where to improve, so you can make smart decisions moving forward.

## Campaign Status

View the campaign status at the top of the page next to the campaign name. Campaigns will be labelled as either 'Live' or 'Complete'.

The date range of the campaign is viewable in the top right of the page. 'Live' campaigns are considered as reports posting data up until the previous day, with an end date shown as ∞. When no data appears for the previous day or beyond, the campaign is marked as 'Complete'.

## Campaign Totals

View key statistics, including total impressions, clicks, click-through rate (CTR), viewability and spend for the entire campaign, in the top row.

The CTR measures the ratio of clicks to impressions, showing how often an ad is clicked compared to how many times it’s displayed (impression). A higher CTR percentage typically indicates a more successful campaign, suggesting the ad was more engaging and relevant to users.

## Filters

You can refine the campaign data for more focused analysis by applying certain campaign filters. These allow you to filter by a specific publisher, individual config units, or a custom date range (within the campaign's start and end dates).

A line chart provides a visual representation of campaign impressions and clicks over time, offering a detailed view of the data across the selected date range. This helps you assess trends and compare the campaign’s performance.

Each table takes the data and groups it into a view that provides a breakdown of the totals from different metrics. These include grouping by line items, config units, creative size, publishers, or device types.
